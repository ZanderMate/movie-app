# Movie App

Deployed App: https://griep-movie-app.netlify.app/

## Description

This app was first conceived by following a tutorial from this site: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-movie-search-app-using-react-hooks-24eb72ddfaf7/, but I decided to keep working on it to add a little more function than just looking up movies.

## Technologies Used:

* Node.js
* React.js
* Bootstrap CSS Framework
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* OMDB API

## How to Use:

1. On the main page, type in a word that is in a movie title. There should be 10 movies that pop up with that title.

2. {More functionalkity to be added at a later date...}
